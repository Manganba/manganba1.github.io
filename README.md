  <p><h2>Some of the programming languages that I practice learning are listed below:</h2><br>
 <u>  <h2>1.HTML:</h2></u><br>
  <h3><ul type ="disc">  
  <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
<li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
<li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
<li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
<li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
<li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</li></ul></h3></p><br>


<u><h2>2.Java:</h2></u><br>
<h3>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),Compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</h3><br>

<u><h2>3.C++:</h2></u><br>
<h3> C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</h3><br>

<u><h2>4.C:</h2></u><br>
<h3>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.</h3><br>
